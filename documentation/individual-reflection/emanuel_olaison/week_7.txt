What do I want to learn or understand better?
  Same as last week, I am not any smarter when it comes to how to break down user-stories into tasks.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  This week I did not help anyone else in the team.
  Banjamin helped me when I got stuck working on the progress notification.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  I helped write user stories and choose how we should work with them this sprint.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  This sprint I have made a system for notifying the user of their progress.
  A pop-up now appears whenever the user has gained a level or an achievement.
  In the the pop-up the user can also share their progress though outher applications.
  I have also fixed a problem where pages do not update correctly.
