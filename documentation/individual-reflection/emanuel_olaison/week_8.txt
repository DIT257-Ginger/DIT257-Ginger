This week I will reflect on the course as a whole as I have done nothing in the course this week, 
I have studied for other exams.

I am happy with how the project turned out and am proud of what we have created together.
While I feel that I contributed an adequate amount to our deliveries and meetings, I feel that I 
sould have put more effort into writing the team reflections.

My understanding of the agile work paradigm has greatly increased. Though I feel that some lectures 
during the sprints would have been good for getting a deeper unserstanding.
