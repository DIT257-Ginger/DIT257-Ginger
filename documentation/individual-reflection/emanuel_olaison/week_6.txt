What do I want to learn or understand better?
  Same as last week, I am not any smarter when it comes to how to break down user-stories into tasks.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  This week I have helped Bashar and Isabella quite a bit.
  They had problems using asynctronus code which I was more familiar with.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  I helped write user stories and choose how we should work with them this sprint.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  This sprint I have made new icons for the different trash types.
  I have also helped Isabella and Bashar with their user-stories.
